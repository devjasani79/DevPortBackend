PATCH /api/shipments/requests/{id}/send-to-shippers
{
  "admin_notes": "High priority shipment, please provide competitive quotes"
}
```

3. **Shipper creates quotation:**
```bash
POST /api/quotations
{
  "shipment_request_id": "request-id",
  "price": 5000,
  "estimated_delivery_days": 7,
  "valid_until": "2024-01-15"
}
```

4. **Admin selects quotation:**

   - Copy contents of `database/workflow_fix.sql`
   - Paste into Supabase SQL editor
   - Execute the migration

2. **Test the workflow:**
   - Use the provided API endpoints
   - Follow the complete workflow example
   - Verify status transitions work correctly

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

1. **Database Schema**: Fixed foreign key constraints and added new workflow fields
2. **Status Management**: Implemented proper status flow throughout the system
